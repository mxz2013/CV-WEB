    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a Ph.D. in physics with experience in data analysis and programming. 
      I particularly enjoy working with the Python scientific stack, which I have been using for more than six years.  As a researcher in academia, I acquired solid mathematical skills, and the ability to work both independently and in a team. Moreover, I am a good storyteller since I have been improving my presentation skills in my academic career when I have to be able to explain complex problems in physics to non-experts, as my CV can attest. 

      After 4 years of academic research as a postdoc, I found my true passion in data science, where the confluence of math, statistics, and computer science (which I all enjoy on their own) provides unique tools that are actually changing the world. I realize that data science offers me unique opportunities to cultivate my skills in a manner that allows me to reach my full career potential.  

      I'm a problem solver at heart and I love to produce actionable solutions for my clients. I enjoy approaching new challenges, working and communicating with a diverse crowd. This just helps to nurture my natural curiosity.
